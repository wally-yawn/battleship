# Reflections
1. Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.
We used the examples provided as well as our own knowledge of battleship to infer the desired behavior of the game.
2. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?
We would like to work on the Intelligent Computer portion of Iteration 4, as well as refactoring the Game class to be a little cleaner and more readable.
3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.
We used both driver/navigator pairing as well as ping ponging individually.
4. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.
We had daily stand-ups and communicated over slack when we were working individually to inform the other of our progress.
